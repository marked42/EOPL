1.  not simple, call-exp (f -(x,1)) in operand position

    ```
    -((f -(x,1)), 1)
    ```

2.  simple, -(-(x,y), 1) in operand position is nested diff-exp/var-exp/const-exp, which is simple

    ```
    (f -(-(x, y), 1))
    ```

3.  simple, zero?(x) is simple in operand position, -(x,y)/-(-(x,y),1) in tail position is also simple

    ```
    if zero?(x) then -(x,y) else -(-(x,y),1)
    ```

4.  proc (y) (y x) is simple in operand position of let-exp, -(x,3) is simple in tail position of let-exp call-exp (y x) is in tail position of proc-exp

    ```
    let x = proc(y) (y x) in -(x,3)
    ```

5.  proc (x) x is simple in operand position of let-exp, call-exp (f 3) is in tail position of let-exp
    x is simple in operand position of proc-exp

    ```
    let f = proc (x) x in (f 3)
    ```
