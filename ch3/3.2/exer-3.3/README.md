Exercise 3.3 [\*] Why is subtraction a better choice than addition for our single arith- metic operation?

Because subtraction is is non-associative, which means `-(a, b)` is different from `-(b, a)`, so when it's same,
we known that we've implemented it wrongly. Meanwhile addition is associative, so we cannot tell when we're doing wrong.
